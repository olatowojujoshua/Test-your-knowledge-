    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will explore **how negation changes the meaning of text** and how to account for it in sentiment analysis.  \n",
    "Negation words like *not*, *never*, or *didn't* can completely flip the sentiment of a sentence (for example, *“good”* vs. *“not good”*).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will experiment with two models to see the effect:\n",
    "1. A **baseline model** using a standard TF–IDF + Logistic Regression pipeline.  \n",
    "2. A **negation-aware model** that preprocesses text to merge negation words with the following token (e.g., *not good → not_good*).\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing their performance, we’ll understand how simple linguistic preprocessing can improve or alter model behavior."
